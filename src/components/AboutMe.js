      Howdy and welcome to my page! I am a dedicated software engineer with a
      strong foundation in many coding languages and industry standard
      practices. A proud graduate of the University of Texas at Dallas, I hold a
      post-graduate certificate in machine learning and AI and am currently
      expanding my expertise with a certificate in front-end development. My
      journey has taken me from Texas to Japan and back, where I spent six
      months immersing myself in a new culture before returning to Austin to
      pursue a dynamic career in the tech industry. Driven by a passion for
      innovation, I am particularly interested in UX design, machine learning,
      AI, and front-end development. I am committed to continuous learning and
      professional growth, with a strong belief in the value of hard work and
      perseverance. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech community
      while further developing my skills and knowledge. Outside of my
      professional endeavors, I am an active member of the Austin Tennis Club,
      regularly participating in social events and tournaments throughout the
      city. I also enjoy exploring Austinâ€™s natural beauty, staying active,
      playing video games, and attending EDM events. I am eager to expand my
      professional network, connect with like-minded individuals, and engage in
      opportunities that allow me to learn and grow both personally and
      professionally.
